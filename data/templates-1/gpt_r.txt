While helping me, you need to output only code that should be appended to my code, do not repat my code  to me.


Hi GPT, I tried implementing the function using the code you provided, but I encountered some errors during compilation. 

The compiler reported the following errors:

{compiler_errors}

I need you to output ONLY code that I will append to my initial code, DO NOT print whole surce. This is really important.

Do not duplicate my code, always print only the code that I need to add at the end of code that i showed you at the begining of conversation, this is really important to me.



Thanks!
